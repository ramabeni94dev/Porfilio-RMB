            I am a versatile Full Stack Developer with a proven track record in
            both corporate and freelance environments. My journey has allowed me
            to design, develop, and deploy scalable web applications using
            cutting-edge technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and
            more. At GÃ–TTERT, I led initiatives to digitize workflows and
            optimize internal processes, while my freelance work has honed my
            skills in crafting tailored solutions that meet diverse client
            needs. I thrive on tackling challenging technical problems,
            collaborating across teams, and continuously evolving to stay at the
            forefront of web development innovation.
